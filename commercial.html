                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">A wave is a single disturbance that travels though some medium from one location to another. A medium is a substance that that carries a wave or carries multiple waves. An example of a medium is a wall because it waves can go through the wall. A change in a medium would be a sound wave going from the air into a wall because the substance that is carrying the wave is changing from air to the wall. A pulse is a single disturbance moving through a medium from on point to another. If you had a wave generator that made multiple waves, it would not be a pulse, it would be many pulses. </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">In the past few years, companies such as DJI and GoPro have created tools to help content producers make higher quality videos. The picture below is a picture of a drone with a camera on it that can be controlled by from a smartphone. Drones have not been limited to delivering items only. In fact, in many modern movies, there are aerial shots such as a high-speed chases or a cliff scenes. Although most people may never notice, most are done using a drone. Also, Drones can be used to record explosion scenes, which would not have been possible to do with a person trying to film it from a nearby distance. Similarly, photographers can use these capabilities to get pictures of real estate and property that people want to look at from aerial point of views. Another common example of Drone photography used in daily life is pictures for weddings and parties. </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">"The use of drones in science has also exploded in use. NASA first experimented with custom-built UAVs in high-altitude research during the late 1970s, but unmanned planes have been slow to catch on. Drones with top-notch sensors were too expensive to tempt researchers and cheap versions could not offer much of value. During the past decade, however, lower prices and technical advances — from onboard navigation using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to miniaturization of autopilots — have lured many scientific groups to experiment with UAVs." In forests such as the Amazon, the forest is so dense that it would take too much time and man hours to explore the entire forest. As of now, only 20% of the living species have been found. There are still 80% of living species which have not been found which we could find drones. You could also use this to explore areas that are uninhabited due to the harsh weather such as the Arctic Circle or the inside of an active volcano. This would allow scientist to find new discoveries. There are also ocean drones that can go underwater and explore that deep ocean. This would allow use to deeper under water without being crushed by the pressure of the water.</p>
