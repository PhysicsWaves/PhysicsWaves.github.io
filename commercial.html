                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">A wave is a single disturbance that travels though some medium from one location to another. A medium is a substance that that carries a wave or carries multiple waves. An example of a medium is a wall because it waves can go through the wall. A change in a medium would be a sound wave going from the air into a wall because the substance that is carrying the wave is changing from air to the wall. A pulse is a single disturbance moving through a medium from on point to another. If you had a wave generator that made multiple waves, it would not be a pulse, it would be many pulses. A wave is a single disturbance that travels though some medium from one location to another. A medium is a substance that that carries a wave or carries multiple waves. An example of a medium is a wall because it waves can go through the wall. Some waves need to travel through a medium, while other do not. For example, sound needs a medium and light does not. A change in a medium would be a sound wave going from the air into a wall because the substance that is carrying the wave is changing from air to the wall. A pulse is a single disturbance moving through a medium from on point to another. If you had a wave generator that made multiple waves, it would not be a pulse, it would be a wave train. </p>





                <font size="6"><font face="Warnock"><p class="lead"> Basic Parts of a Wave</font></font></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">A wave has a few basic parts. The top of the wave is called the crest and the bottom of the wave is called the trough. The amplitude is the distance from the midpoint of the wave to a crest or a trough. This value is a scaler, so it is always positive. The wavelength is the distance from top of one crest to the next crest or it is a trough to the next trough. This will give you the length of one complete cycle. The period is the time for one vibration and the frequency is the number vibrations in the given time, usually in one second. Usually, you can see the frequency of a wave just by looking at it. For example, if the waves are tightly packed together, then it will have a high frequency, but if they are spread apart, it will have a low frequency.   </p>




                <font size="6"><font face="Warnock"><p class="lead">Basic Equations</font></font></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The basic equations needed for this are T=1/f, where T is the period and f is the frequency and f=1/T, where f is the frequency and T is the period. Also the period is in seconds, the frequency is in hertz, the amplitude is in meters and the wavelength is also in meters. </p>
