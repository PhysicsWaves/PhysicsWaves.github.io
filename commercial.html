                    A wave has a few basic parts. The top of the wave is called the crest and the bottom of the wave is called the trough. The amplitude is the distance from the midpoint of the wave to a crest or a trough. This value is a scaler, so it is always positive. The wavelength is the distance from top of one crest to the next crest or it is a trough to the next trough. This will give you the length of one complete cycle. The period is the time for one vibration and the frequency is the number id vibrations in a given time, usually in one second.

                    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
 A wave is a single disturbance that travels though some medium from one location to another. A medium is a substance that that carries a wave or carries multiple waves. An example of a medium is a wall because it waves can go through the wall. A change in a medium would be a sound wave going from the air into a wall because the substance that is carrying the wave is changing from air to the wall. A pulse is a single disturbance moving through a medium from on point to another. If there were multiple pulses it would be called a wave train. The crest to the top part of a wave and the trough is the bottom part of the wave. The amplitude is the distance from the midpoint to a crest or trough. The wavelength is the distance from one crest to the next or from one trough to the next.  The period is the time for one vibration and the frequency is the number of vibrations in a certain amount of time, usually in one second.

<b><p><font size="4.5">Beats</b></p></font>

<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
  Beats are sound waves of different frequencies interfere with each other. When this happens waves are overlapping. The max is when compressions overlap each other and the min is where the compressions meet rarefactions. The beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies. They are also the number of times you hear a loud, soft, loud, soft pattern repeat.

<b><p><font size="4.5">Types of Waves</b></p></font>

<p style="text-indent: 5em;">


  The three types of waves are mechanical, electromagnetic, and matter waves. Mechanical waves need an elastic medium. A few examples of these types of waves are a slinky, sound, rope, and water. There are three types of mechanical waves are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. Longitudinal waves are waves in which particles of a medium move in parallel to the motion of the wave. Transverse waves are particles of a medium that move perpendicular to the motion of the wave. A surface wave is a combination of both of the other waves. An example of this is water because it moves in both directions. In longitudinal waves, compressions are areas of increased pressure and rarefactions are areas of decreased pressure.
